## The Concurrency Order

The concurrent tasks are occurs in sequence. Tas performs all tasks in each concurrency as a **task stream**, and 100 times concurrency correspond to 100 task streams. Consider the following code:

```js
var tester = function(done, count){

    tas.promise(function(){
        process.nextTick(function(){
            tas.resolve();
        });
    });

    tas(function(err, data){
        console.log(count);
        done(count);
    });
};
```

If the tester() is executed 5 times, the map of the tasks streams will be like the following:

The variable count records the serial number of tasks stream. When the current tasks stream execution is completed, done() is called and return count. The count value is match the value passed when tester() is called (otherwise it indicates that the current tasks stream failed).

On the other hand, we can think of count as the context of the execution of the tasks stream, which means that Tas can correctly save the environment variables for each concurrent task, and that all tasks can get the correct environment variables. 

Run the following to experience it:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/tas
$ node benchmark/analytics/concurrency-order/tas.promise.js
```

### Abort in Tas

What happens if we abort in Tas? Well, the remaining tasks in the current tasks stream will not be performed, and the tasks in the next tasks stream will be performs one by one, that's very correct.

Note that if we want to abort in the current task stream, we must use the "begin" flag in first task. Tas uses this flag to determine which of the tasks in the queue belong to the current tasks stream. For example:

```js
var test = function(done, count){
    var a = 0;

    // use 'begin' flag in first task, important.
    tas('begin', { 
        t1: function (){
            a ++;

            tas({
                t2: function(){
                    a ++;
                },

                t3: function(){
                    if (count === 1) {
                      
                        // Or return "abort" if not in nested function (closure)
                        tas.abort();
                    }
                }
            });
        },

        t4: function (){
            a ++;
        }
    });

    tas(function (){
        done(count, a);
    });
};
```

Run the following tests one by one to experience it:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/tas
$ cd test
$ mocha mocha/5.break_the_flow/return_abort.test.js
$ mocha mocha/5.break_the_flow/abort_in_tas.test.js
$ mocha mocha/5.break_the_flow/abort_in_tas.await().test.js
$ mocha mocha/5.break_the_flow/abort_in_tas.promise().test.js
$ mocha mocha/5.break_the_flow/abort_in_tas.forEach().test.js
$ mocha mocha/5.break_the_flow/abort_in_tas.all().test.js
$ mocha mocha/5.break_the_flow/abort_in_tas.race().test.js
```
