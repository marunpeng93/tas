<h1>How to Use</h1>
1. Open this file in your nearest browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE, etc.).<br/>
2. See the logs in console (e.g., in Chrome Developer Tools > console, Dock side > Dock to right).<br/>
3. All test of examples are executed one by one, including async tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<h1>What's Tas</h1>
Tas makes the code elegant. In Tas, we can write a set of micro tasks (including async tasks) instead of a complex function, make the code logic clear and easy to test and maintain. Tas can be used in <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and in browsers. "Tas" is the abbreviation of "tasks".<br/>
<br/>
In Tas, we can insert or remove an async tasks anywhere in any micro task without having to adjust the code elsewhere, all tasks are executed in the order we write, just like the sync tasks, and more better than Promise and generator / yield and async / await, and the tasks <a href="https://github.com/tasjs/tas/tree/master/benchmark/analytics/execution-order/__readme.md" target="_blank">execution order</a> is more reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Tas can performs more than **3 million** sync tasks or **1 million** async tasks per second, faster than native Promise (<a href="https://github.com/tasjs/tas/tree/master/benchmark/__readme.md" target="_blank">Benchmark</a>). With Tas, we can write server code with clear code structure and excellent performance in Node.js.<br/>
