<h1>What's Tas</h1>
Make code simple and easy to maintain. Tas makes the code structure clear, turning async code to sync, reducing the levels, avoiding callback hell / pyramid, is better than Promise. Tas can be used in Node.js and in browsers.<br/>
<br/>
The tasks written by Tas do not need to use Promise / resolve / reject, generator / yield, async / await, so Tas is easier to use than Promise. And, also Tas is faster than Promise and promise libraries <a href="https://github.com/tasjs/tas#why" target="_blank">(Why)</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Tas is a lightweight JavaScript logic framework (only 3KB gzipped), with no dependency. Tas is the abbreviation of "tasks".<br/>
